# Glasses for your spectra

## TODO

- [x] Instead of replacing shared leaves with `0`, replace with some class/object instead
- [ ] Nicer `__repr__` for `ShareModule` that actually says the memory address
- [ ] Add memory address to the top of `print_model_tree`
- [ ] Support tuples, lists and dicts of models as attributes of models
- [ ] Handle non-odd number of modes
- [ ] Write better tests
- [ ] Rigorously type check the tests
